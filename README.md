# Monads, Comonads & Witt vectors
*My bachelor thesis*
The starting point for this bachelor thesis was the following statement:

	The Witt vector functor has a comonadic structure.

The goal for this thesis
is to explain everything that is needed to understand this statement and then prove it.
For this, I will define monads, which are roughly speaking ``monoids on functors'' and comonads, their categorical duals.
I will give lots of examples to get a feeling for 
the definition and prove some important theorems from the theory of monads and comonads.
Since adjunctions play an important role here, I will start by defining adjunctions, 
proving some properties about them and again giving examples. 
In the last sections, I will explain Witt vectors, how to define them and prove 
everything that is needed to finally prove the statement in Theorem \ref{thm: comonad structure}.
At last,
I will show that the teichm√ºller map induces a morphism of comonads between
the free monoid ring comonad and the Witt vector comonad.
